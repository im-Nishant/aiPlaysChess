Every chess position can be represented as 257 bits



Chess moves:
* King - moves one square in any direction. At most once in every game,
         each king is allowed to make a special move, known as castling.
* Queen - moves move any number of vacant squares in any one direction 
          at a time.
* Rook(elephant) - moves any number of vacant squares vertically or 
                   horizontally. It is also moved while castling.
* Bishop - moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.
* Knight - moves one square along any rank or file and then at an angle.
           The knight's movement can also be viewed as an 'L' or '7' 
           laid out at any horizontal or vertical angle.
* Pawns - moves forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it
          has not yet moved, the pawn has option of moving 2 squares 
          forward provided both squares in front of the pawn are 
          unoccupied. It cannot move backward. They can cature an enemy 
          piece at any one of the two squares diagonally in front of 
          them. It is also involved in two special moves, en passant
          and promotion.

* Castling - The king moves 2 squares towards the rook he intends to
             castle with, and the rook moves to the square through
             which the king passed.
             Conditions:
             1. Neither king nor rook involved in castling may have
                moved from the original position.
             2. There must be no pieces between the king and rook.
             3. The king may not currently be in check.
             4. The king may not pass through or end up in a square
                that is under attack by an enemy piece, while rook 
                is permitted.
* En Passant - This may only occur whan a pawn is moved 2 squares on its
               initial movement. When this happens, the opposing player
               has the option to take the moved pawn 'en passant', as if
               it has moved one squrae. This option, though, only stays
               open for one move(immediate move).
* Pawn promotion - If a pawn reaches the opponent's edge of the table,
                   it will be promoted- the pawn may be promoted to a
                   QRBN, with immediate effect.


General Chess Rules:
* White is always the first to move.
* Players take turns alternatively.
* Movement is required.
* If a player's turn is to move, he is not in check but has no legal 
  moves, this situation is called 'Stalemate' and it ends the game in 
  draw.
* When a king is threatened with capture (but can rpotect himself or
  escape), it's called check. If a king is in check, then the player
  must make a move that eliminates the threat of capture and cannot 
  leave the king in check.
* Checkmate happens when a king is placed in check and there is no
  legal move to escape.
* Checkmate ends the game and the side whose king was checked looses.

Initial position - Board is placed such that the white square is on the
                   right side of the player.
                   Light queen at light square while dark queen at the
                   dark square.


Forsyth-Edwards Notation(FEN) : 
* A standard notation for describing a particular board position of a
  chess game.
* A FEN 'record' defines a particular game position, all in one text
  line and using only the ASCII character set.
* A text file with only FEN data records has '.fen' file extension.
* A FEN record contains six fields separated by space.
* The fields are - 
    1. Piece placement from white's perspective. Each rank is
       described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1.
       Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number
       of empty squares), and '/' separates ranks.
    2. Active color : 'w' means white moves next, 'b' means black moves
       next.
    3. Castling availibility : '-' if neither side can castle,
       otherwise this has one or more letters from 'K'(white can castle
       kingside), 'Q'(white can castle queenside), 'k'(black can castle
       kingside), 'q'(black can castle queenside).
    4. En passant target square in algebraic notation. '-' if no en
       passant square. If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is
       the position 'behind' the pawn. This is recorded regardless of
       whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant
       capture.
    5. Halfmove clock : Number of halfmoves since the last capture or
       pawn advance. This is used to determine if a draw can be
       claimed under the fifty-move rule.
    6. Fullmove number : Number of the full move. It starts at 1, and
       is incremented after Black's move.
Example : 
* FEN for starting position:
 rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
